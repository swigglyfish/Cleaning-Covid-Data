<h1 align="center">Cleaning Covid Datasets</h1>
<img src="Photos/covid.png" width=100%>

In this project, I clean four datasets containing information about Covid-19 caseloads and deaths and then use the cleaned data to create a Tableau visualization, which can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ben.lewis8849#!/vizhome/CovidProject_16149111118260/Covid-19CasesandDeaths). The four datasets examined are as follows:
- Global Cases = cummulative number of people who tested postive for Covid-19 for a certain date by country
- Global Deaths = cummulative number of people who died from Covid-19 for a certain date by country
- US Cases = cummulative number of people who texted positive for Covid-19 for a certain date by US state and county
- US Deaths = cummulative number of people who died from Covid-19 for a certain date by US state and county

All four datasets can be found within the Source Files folder, which is nested within the Data Files folder. These four datasets were collected from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
